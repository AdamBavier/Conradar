## Design Purpose
- ConRadar is an app for the passive adventurer
- Designed with little user interaction
- Not an invasive app, set up once and use forever
- Constructed for trip goers who seldom inform others of where they are going
- Safety net in the event of an emergency
- Inform contacts with user's location data and a message

## Features
- Geofence

    - Set and create a geofence around your safe zone on a map
    - Encompass frequently visited areas
    - Change the size of the radius with a slide bar
    - While inside adventure mode is off
    - Once outside adventure mode is on and the app records your location
    - The app will either:

	    - Turn off adventure mode once you return
	    - Inform contacts if you return after a predesignated amount of time

- Contact Settings

    - Create contacts you want notified in the event of an emergency
    - Contacts can be notified via text message or email
    - A default message, or a custom message accompanies every notification

- Preferences

    - Modify the default message that is sent alongside the location information
    - Change the “time out” period, the time the app waits before sending out notifications
    - Create days where the app will be inactive, in the event of frequent travel
    - Set upcoming trips, where the time out will be longer than the standard trip length
